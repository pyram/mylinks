[SOCENT](http://www.socentnetwork.com/ "SOCENT") exposes Montreal's social entrepreneurs to each other, the city, and the world.

We organize activities to tackle climate change, inactive transportation, education challenges, and manage the Salon 1861 co-creation lab for social innovators.

Our mission is to create a ripple effect for social change!
