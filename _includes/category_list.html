								<h3><b>Touch Screen User Interface for Pollution Instrumentation</b></h3>
Carbon monoxide is a toxic byproduct of some processes that reduce oxygen delivery in organisms at high levels. Neubloc’s touch screen prototype to monitor and manage carbon monoxide output generated by smokestacks is easy to use, with rich GUI and a 7” VGA resolution panel. This interface identifies problems quickly with a simple click, generating detailed error messages and histograms.
