Enough talk already. The best way to learn Lean Startup (or to be an entrepreneur) is to just do it!</p>

<p>In this mini-workshop, we’ll focus on the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Identifying and stating your most critical assumption</li>
  <li>Identifying your top 2 market segments (the actionable ones)</li>
  <li>Validating your value proposition or unfair advantage (whatever you are working with)</li>
</ul>

<p>This mini-workshop will give you acces to Lean Startup coaches as well as the brain and entrepreneurial power of other participants.</p>

<p>Given we have a limited number of coaches this mini-workshop will be limited to 16 participants so reserve you spot now!</p>
