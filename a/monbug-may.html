<p>It’s the last regular MonBUG meeting before the summer break!</p>

<p>We’re in the very early stages of planning a hackathon for June, before going on holiday.</p>

<p>It is not too early to reserve a spot for 2016-2017 to share your research with your colleagues. We’re hoping to be able to offer prizes for speakers starting in May.</p>

<p>Alain has done a great job recruiting sponsors.
We’d like to thank Dr. Shoubridge and the McGill Department of Human Genetics for renewing their sponsorship for another year, and recognizing the important role that MonBUG, and bioinformaticians in general, can play in the Montreal scientific community.</p>
