Enough talk already. The best way to learn Lean Startup (or to be an entrepreneur) is to just do it!

In this mini-workshop, we'll focus on the following:

- Identifying and stating your most critical assumption
- Identifying your top 2 market segments (the actionable ones)
- Validating your value proposition or unfair advantage (whatever you are working with)

This mini-workshop will give you acces to Lean Startup coaches as well as the brain and entrepreneurial power of other participants.

Given we have a limited number of coaches this mini-workshop will be limited to 16 participants so reserve you spot now!

Pizza & drinks will be served.
