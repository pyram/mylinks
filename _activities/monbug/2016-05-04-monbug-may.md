## Agenda

16:00 - 16:05 Introduction - Alain Bateman
16:05 - 16:35 Nehme Hachem -"Decoding compound mechanism of actions using integrative pharmacogenomics"  
16:35 - 17:05 Hector Galvez - "Transcriptome analysis and de novo motif discovery predict putative nitrogen responsive regulatory DNA motifs in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.)"
17:05 - 17:25 Break with snacks and beverages
17:25 - 18:00 Tariq Daouda - "Mariana: The Cutest Deep Learning Framework"

It's the last regular MonBUG meeting before the summer break!

We're in the very early stages of planning a hackathon for June, before going on holiday.

It is not too early to reserve a spot for 2016-2017 to share your research with your colleagues. We're hoping to be able to offer prizes for speakers starting in May.

Alain has done a great job recruiting sponsors.
We'd like to thank Dr. Shoubridge and the McGill Department of Human Genetics for renewing their sponsorship for another year, and recognizing the important role that MonBUG, and bioinformaticians in general, can play in the Montreal scientific community.
