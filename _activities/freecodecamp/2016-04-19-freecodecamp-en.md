We're an open source community of busy people who learn to code and help nonprofits.

Learning to code is hard. To succeed, you'll need lots of practice and support. That's why we've created a rigorous curriculum and supportive community.

There are thousands of coding jobs currently going unfilled, and the demand for coders grows every year.

Free Code Camp is a proven path to your first coding job. In fact, no one has actually completed our entire program, because campers get jobs before they're able to.

We have hundreds of optional coding challenges that will teach you fundamental web development technologies like HTML5, Node.js and databases.

We believe humans learn best by doing. So you'll spend most of your time actually building projects. We'll give you a list of specifications (agile user stories), and you'll figure out how to build apps that fulfill those specifications.

Our curriculum is divided into 4 certifications. These certifications are standardized, and instantly verifiable by your freelance clients and future employers. Like everything else at Free Code Camp, these certifications are free. We recommend doing them in order, but you are free to jump around. The first three certifications take 400 hours each, and the final certification takes 800 hours, and involves building real-life projects for nonprofits.

To earn our Back End Development Certification, you'll build 10 projects using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. You'll use Git and Heroku to deploy them to the cloud.

After you complete all three of these certificates, you'll team up with another camper and use agile software development methodologies to build two real-life projects for nonprofits. You'll also add functionality to two legacy code nonprofit projects. By the time you finish, you'll have a portfolio of real apps that people use every day.

If you complete all 2,080 hours worth of challenges and projects, you'll earn our Full Stack Development Certification. We'll offer you free coding interview practice. We even offer a job board where employers specifically hire campers who've earned Free Code Camp certifications.
