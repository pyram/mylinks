You and your friends can edit and create new activities.

To **edit** an activity (did you spot a spelling mistake?) simply follow the *Improve this page* link at the top of most pages on [bettermtl.com](http://bettermtl.com).

To **create** a new activity:

- Create a **New file** in the <code class="highlighter-rouge"><a href="https://github.com/bettermtl/bettermtl.github.io/tree/master/_activities" target="_blank">_activities</a></code> directory
- Copy the example activity bellow to get a head start, you can delete the `[optional]` details which you cannot specify at this time, for example you may not know the `location` yet - come back later to edit and update the activity
- Ensure the file name has the `.md` ending
- **Commit changes** to save

In a few moments, you'll see your changes appear on [bettermtl.com](http://bettermtl.com)

## Get involved

(in order of difficulty â˜º)

- [Chat with us on gitter](https://gitter.im/bettermtl/general) - anyone can do this!
- Locations (in <code class="highlighter-rouge"><a href="https://github.com/bettermtl/bettermtl.github.io/tree/master/_locations" target="_blank">_locations</a></code>) and people (in <code class="highlighter-rouge"><a href="https://github.com/bettermtl/bettermtl.github.io/tree/master/_network" target="_blank">_network</a></code>) work similarly to activities (in <code class="highlighter-rouge"><a href="https://github.com/bettermtl/bettermtl.github.io/tree/master/_activities" target="_blank">_activities</a></code>)
- Add a translation: create new file, use same `ref` and add the `lang` attribute in the front-matter, e.g.: `"en"` for English (`lang` defaults to `"fr"` when not specified)
- [Submit new issues or comments on waffle](https://waffle.io/bettermtl/bettermtl.github.io)
